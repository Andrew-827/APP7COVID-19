Brief Description of Goal of Code:
The goal of this code is to help a patient or user distinguish between allergies and the common other. The code is supposed to ask a series of questions to diagnose one or the other.
 
Known Issues:
This app is extremely basic and doesn't include a comprehensive amount of questions to distinguish between other and allergies.
